# INTRODUCTION
The Week 1 project of Data with Danny 8 weeks SQL Challenge as seen on https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/ is about Danny's Diner, a small Japanese restaurant owned by Danny, is struggling to stay afloat. The restaurant serves sushi, curry, and ramen, but lacks the expertise to analyze and utilize its basic operational data collected over a few months. Help is needed to guide Danny's Diner in using its data to inform business decisions and ensure the restaurant's success.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Danny wants to analyze his customer data to:

1. Understand visiting patterns
2. Track spending habits
3. Identify favorite menu items

He aims to use these insights to:

1. Enhance the customer experience
2. Inform decisions on expanding the loyalty program

## DATASET

Due to privacy concerns, Danny has provided a sample dataset. He needs help creating SQL queries to answer his questions and generating easily accessible datasets for his team.
Danny has shared 3 key datasets for this case study:

* sales
* menu
* members

## CASE STUDY QUESTIONS

Each of the following case study questions were answered using SQL statement:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
